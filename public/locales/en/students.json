                "answer": "You are going to live in someone else’s home. A good match is therefore very important. In order to maximize the change of success of a match, it is important to have a clear profile of both the student and the host. This speeds up the process and prevents possible confusion later on."

In order to maximize the chance of success, it is wise to keep an eye on your mailbox after registration. As soon as we have a new offer that matches your profile, you will receive an email from us. It is then important to respond to this as quickly as possible. We select a number of profiles from these responses and the landlady then makes the choice of who will live with him or her."

                "answer": "We have not forgotten you, but have not yet found an offer that matches your profile. Many factors play a role in the background in order to create a suitable match. It may be that a host asks for a man in the final phase of a study, wants to rent the room for only three months or is specifically looking for a French-speaking student. We do our best to find something suitable for everyone. New offers are constantly coming in, so there may just be a match with you!"

                "question": "I responded to a room, but I don't hear anything.",
                "answer": "We send new offers to students whose profile matches the preferences of the host. From these responses we select a number of profiles that we present to the host. The host makes then a choice. We will let you know if you are presented to a host. If you don't hear anything, you are unfortunately not selected. Continue to respond to new offers that come in!"

                "answer": "As soon as a host registers with us, we visit and ask all preferences. It is in fact not nothing to take an international student into your own home. We then link these preferences to our student information database. If your details match the preferences of the host you are introduced to the host. Sometimes you are introduced together with up to three other students, sometimes you are lucky and you are the only one. The host makes a choice based on our proposal. As soon as there is a match you will receive a message from us immediately!"

We exchange the contact details between the host and student so that you can get in touch with each other. This can be done via a visit, via skype or by telephone. If a connection is there you can draft up a contract. The host can choose to use a sample contract from Hospi Housing that has also been translated into English. Afterwards we withdraw and you can get prepared for a new adventure."

                "question": "I want to renew my contract, is that possible?",
                "answer": "This is possible in consultation with the host. If there is a connection from both sides, chances are that a contract will be extended. This of course depends on the availability of the room at the host. Therefore always first discuss this with the host and then draw up a new contract together."

                "question": "I live with a host, but I don't like it.",
                "answer": "That's a shame to hear. Hospi Housing pays a lot of attention to achieve a good match. Unfortunately it sometimes happens that there is simply no connection or that one of the two had different expectations. As a tenant you can terminate the contract with a cancellation period of one month. The host can terminate the contract in the first nine months of the rental period with a three-month notice period."

We not only strive for a good match, but also always want a safe and confidential living environment for the student. Hospi Housing always personally contacts new hosts and visits each new host personally to get acquainted. If a host does not meet the conditions of Hospi Housing, the room will not be offered through Hospi Housing."
