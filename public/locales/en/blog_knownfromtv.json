But this year there is also notice for solutions. <1>Among others</1>, the local Dutch newspaper AD and broadcaster RTV Utrecht made stories of students who found a room with a host, thanks to the help of Hospi Housing.",
    "listitem_2": "<1>Here</1> you can read (in Dutch) the story of the Malaisian En Ning, who now lives at a beautiful location with landlady Yvonne in Utrecht. Or watch (again in Dutch, sorry..) the <2>short movie</2> about the Portugese student Maria living with the guest family of Maarten.",
    "listitem_3": "Hospi Housing has had a few crazy months. Two months after the start of the pilot in July this year, already over 30 hosts and 250 students have registered with Hospi Housing. Students looking for a room and hosts with a room to spare. Six students have already moved in with a host, but there must be more! We are working hard to find more hosts in Utrecht and surroundings.",
