    "intro_text": "We have a series of two guest blogs, written by an international student living in Utrecht. From her own experiences she will provide you with valuable advice on how to prepare and what to expect from living in Utrecht. Got your pen and paper ready? Lets go:",
    "listitem_1": "<1>1. Find a house.</1> This should be your main concern since there are far fewer houses available than needed. First: start looking for a place at least six months in advance. Second: spread your chances, join Facebook pages and apply on <2>different websites</2> like SSH and (of course) <3>Hospi Housing</3>. Third: be aware of scammers! If you find a house through a private individual, do not pay anything before you’ve visited the house or met the owner. [Dispute with your landlord, questions about your contract or paying too much rent? Contact the <4>Legal Assistance office of Vidius</4>. They will help you for free.] ",
    "listitem_2": "<1>2. Register in town.</1> If you want to live in Utrecht you need to register in town. But be aware(!): making an appointment will take around 2-3 weeks. Make sure this is the first thing you do after you land. If you stay for more than four months, <2>register here</2>. If you cannot register (always check with your landlord beforehand(!)) or if you stay shorter than 4 months, you can <3>apply for the RNI</3>, which will give you the insurance working number (BSN) you need in order to work here.",
    "listitem_3": "<1>3. Do I need health care?</1> The doctors and hospitals in the Netherlands are expensive. Make sure you have a good insurance health care before you come, either with your scholarship or as a European citizen. <2>More information</2>.",
    "listitem_4": "<1>4. Get a Dutch bank account.<1> You will need for transport, to print at the University and to pay almost everywhere. Most places don’t accept cash and foreign credit or debit cards. Don’t bring cash with you! You will have to pay a commission if you want to put that money on your new bank account. It’s better to do a simple transfer from your regular bank account. One of the requirements to open a bank account is a RNI or BSN, so make sure <2>you have one</2> by then!",
    "listitem_5": "<1>5. Bikes, bikes, bikes!</1> Buy or rent a bike as soon as possible. I recommend <2>Swapfiets</2>, but be aware you will need a Dutch debit card to pay for it. Transport in the Netherlands is one of the most expensive in Europe. Make sure you buy your <3>OV-chipkaart</3>, since you cannot pay with cash on the bus and without a card you will pay an extra commission for every trip.",
    "listitem_6": "<1>6. Shopping with a student budget.</1> The cheapest supermarkets to do your daily groceries are Lidl and Aldi. A bit more expensive but customer-friendly are Albert Heijn and Jumbo. For hygiene or pharmacy products go to Kruidvat or Etos and look for their discount promotions. Also check out Action. They sell all sorts of things for a very low price (they buy in big and their assortment varies).",
    "listitem_7": "<1>7. Academic life.</1> For questions related to academic programs, lectures or timetables go to the <2>International Office of Utrecht University</2> or to the <3>Student Desk</3>. Also, there’s plenty of groups on Facebook depending on your Degree, Master or Faculty.",
    "listitem_8": "<1>8. Get your phone NL-ready.</1> Some apps are essential during your stay in the Netherlands. For transport use <2>9292</2> or <3>NS</3>, or go easy and just use Google Maps. To prepare for unexpected weather you will need <4>Buienradar</4> or <5>Buienalarm</5>. Use your moments in public transport or while hiding for the rain to practice your Dutch with <6>duolingo</6>. You will also need the app of your <7>local bank</7> and the University card and timetable (<8>MyUU</8> or <9>MyHU</9>. To sell and buy second-handed stuff use <10>Marktplaats</10> or go to a local <11>Kringloopwinkel</11>. Want to buy new stuff, go to <12>Bol.com</12> (it’s like the Dutch Amazon).",
    "listitem_9": "<1>9. Don’t miss the fun!</1> Utrecht is a very active city, almost every day you will have something interesting to do. There’s a lot of parties, festivals, concerts, museums and exhibitions. Just keep an eye on the <2>events on Facebook</2> and check out some places like ACU, EKKO or Casco.",
    "listitem_10": "<1>10. Get involved with your community!</1> There’s lots of groups on Facebook such as \"Españoles en Utrecht\", \"Italiani ad Utrecht\" or \"Utrecht Francophone\". Do a quick research and find your group there, you can always ask for advice or just share some knowledge in your own language!"
