Think about recommendations such as good restaurants or the best shopping places. A student could also use your knowhow how to get around with public transport.

Costs for food and drinks are not included. You must make agreements with the student in advance about the use of household appliances.

                "question": "Hoe zit het met gemeentelijke belasting?",
                "answer": "If you live alone, you are considered a single household. However, as soon as a student comes to live with you, you will be regarded as a multi-person household. This can lead to an increase in municipal taxes. If you already live with more than one person in the house, nothing will change. Hospi Housing advises to charge €55,- on top of the basic rent, and that includes gas, water and electricity. If you want to know exactly how much your municipal taxes will increase each year, please contact your municipality."

                "question": "Mag ik de huurprijs tussendoor wijzigen?",
                "answer": "The student and host will sign an agreement with a set price including additional services such as gas, water and electricity. It is not possible to change the price or charge additional costs during the stay. Hospi Housing requires a copy of the contract between the student and host before the student moves in."

                "question": "Kan ik de huur zomaar beëindigen?",
                "answer": "This depends on the type of rental contract. With a rental contract for hosts you can terminate the rent without giving a reason. This way you keep control over who lives in your house. The rental protection does not apply in the first nine months of the rental period. After nine months, the student is entitled to rental protection. Please note: a cancellation period of 3 months also applies in the first nine months. A rental agreement for a specific period cannot be terminated prematurely by the lessor. The tenant has a notice period of at least one and at most three months."

                "answer": "In most cases you are, but this depends on your insurance and personal situation. Under most policy conditions you are obliged to let your insurer know when you rent a room in your home. This applies to both your household and property insurance and your liability insurance. Hospi Housing therefore recommends that you always contact your insurer before you sign a contract with the student. Your own insurer can best advise you on whether renting a room in your home has consequences for your home and liability insurance."

The income does count if it is a <2>benefit partner</2> or a <3>co-resident</3>. Are you unsure whether your tenant is a roommate or subtenant?

                "answer": "No, usually not. Renting out a part of your own home to a student is seen as a 'commercial relationship' and does not affect the amount of your state pension. Only if you are married to your roommate, a registered partnership or a joint household does this count towards your state pension. See for more information and examples <1>this page of the SVB</1>."
